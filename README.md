# Syncer: sync & manipulate data from MySQL/MongoDB to Elasticsearch/MySQL/Http Endpoint

## Features

### Consistency

#### Consistent mode: 
  - `strict`: make sure output is successful, otherwise, retry until success
  - `loose`: try to send to output

#### Consistency Promise

- If network has problem, MySQL master slave protocol?
- Input module remember where we leave, try to not miss data if syncer shutdown in accident
- If data is still not send in output channel when input is starting to handle next event, and syncer shutdown?
- If output channel fail to send to output target, retry until success


### Input

- Support listening to both MySQL & MongoDB
- MySQL master source filter:
  - Schema filter, support regex
  - Table name filter
  - Interested column filter
  - automatic primary key detection and set into `id`
  - If a table match multiple schema & table (because the usage of regex), a exception will be thrown
  - If an event go through column filter, and only primary key is left:
    - If event type is UPDATE_ROWS, then discard this event -- because not support update id now;
    - Other event type, keep it.
- MongoDB master source filter:
  - Version: 3.x
  - Schema filter, support regex
  - Collection name filter
  - automatic `_id` detection and set into `id`
  - If an event match multiple schema & table, we will use the first specific match to filter/output,
  i.e. the specific schema config will override the regex schema config
  - If an event go through column filter, and only primary key is left:
    - If event type is UPDATE_ROWS, then discard this event -- because not support update id now;
    - Other event type, keep it.
- Remember start file/position of binlog/oplog, and resume from where we leave so as to avoid any data loss
  - More than once: we can ensure the at least once semantics now, so you need to make sure your `SyncData`
  is idempotent and your destination can handle it. Counterexample: a table without primary key definitely
  can't handle it and cause duplicate data soon or later.
- Multiple consumer can share a common connection to same data source, i.e. MySQL/MongoDB


### Filter

Manipulate `SyncData` through (for more details, see input part of *Pipelinie Config*):

- `if`
- `switcher`
- `foreach`
- all public method in `SyncData`:
  - `addRecord(String key, Object value)` 
  - `renameRecord(String oldKey, String newKey)` 
  - `removeRecord(String key)`
  - `removeRecords(String... keys)` 
  - `containRecord(String key)` 
  - `updateRecord(String key, Object value)` 
  - ...
  - `syncByQuery()`
  - `insertByQuery(String schemaName, String tableName)`
- all data field in `SyncData`:
  - `schema`
  - `table`
  - `id`
  - `records`
  - `extra`

### Output
- Elasticsearch
  - Version: 5.x
  - Bulk operation
  - Update/Delete documents by `UpdateByQuery` or `DeleteByQuery`
  - Join/merge documents from different source when push to ES<sup>[1](#join_in_es)</sup>
    - One to many relationship (parent-child relationship in ES)for document in different index
    - Self referential relationship handle

- Http Endpoint
- MySQL
 - Bulk operation
 - Simple nested sql: `insert into select`

<a name="join_in_es">[1]</a>: Be careful about this feature, it may affect your performance

## Usage 

- MySQL config
  - binlog_format: row
  - binlog_row_image: full
- MongoDB config:
  - (optional) update `bind_ip` to allow listens for connections from applications on configured addresses.
  - start with enable replication set: 
    - `mongod --replSet myapp`
    - Or use docker: `docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -v /root/mongodb-container/db:/data/db mongo:3.2 mongod --replSet chat`
  - init replication set in shell: `rs.initiate()`

### Limitation
- MySQL:
  - Supported version: depend on this [binlog connector lib](https://github.com/shyiko/mysql-binlog-connector-java)
  - Not support composite primary key
  - Not support update primary key
  - Only support update/delete by query exact value, i.e. no support query analyzed field (`text` query when update)

## Notice

- Don't update/delete use `syncer` and other way (REST api or Java api) at the same time, it may cause version conflict and fail the change
- Update/Delete by query will be executed at once, i.e. will not be buffered or use batch


## Producer Data Source Config
## TODO
- Support set parent of ES
- Row image format support?
  - Add must appeared field restriction -- now only primary key
  - Opt: keep only changed field in update event & primary key in delete event -- include must appear field
- Join by query mysql?
- Make all output channel strict

- MySQL master connection
- Mongo master connection

## Consumer Pipeline Config

### Input
- MySQL master connection: specify the master want to listen to
- Mongo master connection: specify the master want to listen to
### Filter

- statement: implemented by Spring EL, can call all public method in `SyncData`
- switcher
  - support `default` case
  - only execute one case
- foreach: in most cases, you can use [Spring EL's collection projection](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/expressions.html) rather than this feature
- if
  - clone: clone a new event
  - drop
  - statement: same with outer `statement`
  - dup: duplicate multiple event
  - switch
  - foreach
- all public method in `SyncData`:
  - `addRecord(String key, Object value)` 
  - `renameRecord(String oldKey, String newKey)` 
  - `removeRecord(String key)`
  - `removeRecords(String... keys)` 
  - `containRecord(String key)` 
  - `updateRecord(String key, Object value)` 
  - ...
  - `syncByQuery()`: update/delete by query, now only support ES
    - `SyncByQueryES`
  - `insertByQuery(String schemaName, String tableName)`: usually work with `clone` & `dup` to convert one event to multiple events
    - `ExtraQuery`
- all data field in `SyncData`:
  - `schema`: schema/db/index
  - `table`: table or collection
  - `id`: data primary key or similar thing
  - `records`: data content of this sync event converted from log content according to your config. 
  **Notice**: 
    - if your interested column config (`rowName`) has name of `id`, records will have it. Otherwise, it will only in `id` field;
  - `extra`: an extra map to store extra info

### Output Choice

 - Elasticsearch
  - When using this channel, you may prefer to not include `id` like field in interested column config (`rowName`),
  because it is always no need to include it in data field for ES and we will auto detect it and set it for you.
 - MySQL
 - Http endpoint

  masters:
    - connection:
        address: ${HOST_ADDRESS}

```
## Run
```
git clone https://github.com/zzt93/syncer
mvn package
java -server -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar syncer.jar --producerConfig=/absolute/path/to/producer.yml --consumerConfig=/absolute/path/to/consumer1.yml,/absolute/path/to/consumer2.yml
```

## Test
### Correctness Test
Test data: 
  - size: 7M
  - machines: 3
  - databases: 3 in logic, after horizontal split is 24
  - tables: 90+ for each database; listening: 5 for each database
  - types: bigint, varchar, text, tinyint, timestamp, smallint, int, unsigned, longtext

### Stress Test
- 10G & 10^8 lines
  - load every 10^5 lines by `mysqlimport`
  - no pause between import
- Throughput: limited by filter worker number, in average 1200+ events per worker
- CPU: 80-90
- Memory: 4g
- IO
  - Network
  - Disk
- JVM
  - Thread
  - Lock contention 

### Used In Production
- For search data sync
- For auth data sync

## TODO
- Order problem: make same id to same thread; strict mode: retry error item and all left; retry only error item
- Add file as data source: to read binlog file
- Support set parent of ES
- Row image format support?
  - Add must appeared field restriction -- now only primary key
  - Opt: keep only changed field in update event & primary key in delete event -- include must appear field
- Join by query mysql?

---

## Implementation

### Input Module

- Load yml file into environment property source
- Bind property source into config model class

#### Problem & Notice

- For collection field: getter and setter will all be invoked -- this behavior depends on Spring Boot
  - If only invoke getter?
  - For list and map field, has different behavior:
    - list: `list = getList(); list.clear(); list.add(xxx); setList(list);`
    - map: `map = getMap(); map.add(xxx); setMap(map);`

### Output Module

#### Json Mapper
- For now, mapping document value using `toString()`: {@link XContentBuilder#unknownValue}
  - java.sql.Timestamp format: 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS'. For now, if you need other format, you have to format it to string by yourself
  - Maybe change to jackson
